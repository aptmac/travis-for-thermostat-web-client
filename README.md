## Dependencies:

`npm`, which will pull down all other dependencies.

`keycloak.json` generated by a Keycloak server (if desired, ie, running with
`NODE_ENV=production`), placed in `src/app/components/auth/`. The file contents should
look like:

    {
        "url": "http://some.domain:PORT/auth",
        "realm": "FooRealm",
        "clientId": "BarClientId"
    }

## How to use

Live-reload development:

`npm run devserver`, then point a web browser at localhost:8080.

One-time build:

`npm run build`

Non-live-reload web-server:

`npm start`, then point a web browser at localhost:8080.

In this case, you may run the server on a different port than the default 8080
by setting the environment variable `PORT` to a port number of your choosing.
The server also binds by default on `0.0.0.0`, which can be overridden with the
environment variable `HOST`.

Run tests:

`npm test` (one-time) or `npm run test-watch` (live-reload)
