## Dependencies:

`npm`, which will pull down all other dependencies.

`keycloak.json` generated by a Keycloak server (if desired, ie, running with
`NODE_ENV=production`), placed in `src/app/components/auth/`. The file contents should
look like:

    {
        "url": "http://some.domain:PORT/auth",
        "realm": "FooRealm",
        "clientId": "BarClientId"
    }

## Environments

Expected values for `NODE_ENV`:

- `production` for production environments, which produces a smaller application
bundle and expects Keycloak configuration

- `testing` for test environments, ex. CI

- `development` for individual developers' machines

In `testing` and `development`, one hard-coded user exists. The username is
`test-user` and the password is `test-pass`. This is intended _only_ for
development and testing, never for deployments.

When building with `npm run build`, these values should be set via a standard
shell environment variable. When building with `s2i build`, the file `.s2i/environment`
should exist and contain ex. `NODE_ENV=production`.

## How to use

Live-reload development:

`npm run devserver`, then point a web browser at localhost:8080.

One-time build:

`npm run build`

Non-live-reload web-server:

`npm start`, then point a web browser at localhost:8080.

In this case, you may run the server on a different port than the default 8080
by setting the environment variable `PORT` to a port number of your choosing.
The server also binds by default on `0.0.0.0`, which can be overridden with the
environment variable `HOST`.

Run tests:

`npm test` (one-time) or `npm run test-watch` (live-reload)

### Source-to-Image

`s2i` can also be used to produce an application image. The expected base image
is `centos/nodejs-4-centos7`, although others may also work. The build invocation
will look like `s2i build . centos/nodejs-4-centos7 thermostat-web-client` and
running the image will look like `docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 thermostat-web-client`,
which will bind the application to port 8888 on the host machine.

The `PORT` and `HOST` variables outlined above may also be set in `.s2i/environment`.

### OpenShift

In order to deploy this web-client on OpenShift do:

    $ oc new-app centos/nodejs-4-centos7~https://github.com/andrewazores/thermostat-web-client

## Keycloak Configuration

Follow the Thermostat Web-Gateway configuration guide for Keycloak. See the
top of this file for where to place the generated `keycloak.json`.

Additionally, configure the Client on the Keycloak Server with the following
parameters:

`Valid Redirect URIs: http://localhost:8080/*` (or similar)

`Web Origins: +`
